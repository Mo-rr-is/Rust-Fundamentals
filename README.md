# Rust-Fundamentals
This is a Rust Programming Repo containing various example files that can help in learning Rust from basics.

## Example 1
As usual the first example is to print the Hello, World string using rust. This is done by first creating a main function, **fn main()**, that accepts no parameters. Inside the function, we can print the text using **println!()** command. You can run the program and print the text in a command line.

That's how you make a simple hello world application using Rust Programming

## Example 2
Next, we create a Hello, World application using a **Cargo**. Cargo is used to build applications and dependencies in Rust. In this case we use the command **cargo new hello-world-cargo --bin**. The bin at the end flags this as being an application and not a library. To run this cargo, simply go to the cargo directory and then use the command **cargo run**.
