# Rust-Fundamentals
This is a Rust Programming Repo containing various example files that can help in learning Rust from basics.

## Example 1
As usual the first example is to print the Hello, World string using rust. This is done by first creating a main function, **fn main()**, that accepts no parameters. Inside the function, we can print the text using **println!()** command. You can run the program and print the text in a command line.

That's how you make a simple hello world application using Rust Programming
